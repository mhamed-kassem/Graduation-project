# Graduation-project
Diseases detection based on machine learning using internet of things 
the project contain two main parts hardware(arduino) and software(android App, machine learning on web service)

_Hardware:
--components:
.Arduino nano
.bluetooth chep HC-05
.heart rate sensor
.temperature sensor
.battery
.on/off key
--mission
collect body indicators and send it to android app within bluetooth

_software
.android app show health data to user and 
.upload health data to firebase cloud in order to be available to access 
and show from anywhere in the world (doctor can follow patients all the time any where )
.android app send health data to machine learning algorithm on web service 
and recieve the result that say if person is sick or no

_techniques
.android development -java
.machine learning -python
.webservice
.firebase
.internet of things
.arduino 



------------
